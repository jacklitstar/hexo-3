# 彻底死去了？  
github won't let me deploy the pages via a workflow for some reason. The old repository had a bad deploy that got cancled by the server and it got stuck in the UI so that it shows up as a finished action that I can't cancel. The cancel button doesn't really work. I tied to add my custom domain to github pages but I get the prompt: **You cannot set a custom domain at this time.** Fuck. So I created a new repository and dumped all the old files in hoping it would solve the stupid issue of a stuck repository but it seems like it aint working. Off to a good start, weeeeeeeeeeee. Also my github account has been flagged. You apparently need a phone number from a selected country or region - ofcourse yall know what the means.   
I'm trying to follow the initial guide to set up the thing all over again.
